# amazon-fba-insights

The purpose of Amazon FBA Insights to allow Amazon Sellers to perform analytics on their business without sharing their business data with 3rd parties and/or paying fees to 3rd parties to perform analytics for them.

Amazon FBA insights downloads reports from your Amazon account and stores data in a database on your machine locally.

From there, analytics can be performed to provide any type of insight into your business operations.

Anything from inventory stock predictions to SKU profitability.

Amazon FBA Insights empowers sellers to control their own data and decision making without the cost of subscriptions or limited by a 3rd party's capability to deliver insights.

It's our goal to provide a community developed application that is Free and open-source software (FOSS).

This allows anyone inspect the code for their own security and better understand how the analytics are being generated.
